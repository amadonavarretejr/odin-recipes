# odin-recipes
Welcome to my basic recipe website! This site serves as a demonstration of the fundamental HTML skills I have acquired through "theodinproject". Although it's simplistic in design, it showcases my ability to structure web content and create a user-friendly interface.

New Note: I am introducing a fresh update to my recipe website. I'm excited to incorporate my newly acquired knowledge of CSS. I plan on enhancing the visual appeal and user experience of the site by adding color, new fonts, and new text alignment.
